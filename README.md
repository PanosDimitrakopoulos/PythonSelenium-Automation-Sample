# PythonSelenium-Automation-Sample

This is a simple Automation Sample using Gherkin (Behave), Selenium and Python. The Code is unusable as it is but it is provided like that to present the thought process behind class, step, page and function creation and usage in a test.

We are breaking up each component by Page, Feature Files and Step Files while saving the data in separate files and creating functions to be used in each one of the page. We first create the Feature File Scenarios and then initialize the steps.py file steps. 
Also, we are creating the methods needed for each step in the respective page file and call them in steps. Assertions are primarily created in the step level (but some of them could be also created in page files).
